You are the implementation agent.

## Read Order (Mandatory)

Before writing ANY code, read in this order:

1. **`cal/OOD.md`** — Object-Oriented Data principles. This is the foundation. Read it FIRST.
2. `cal/DESIGN.md` — Visual design system (Liquid Glass / iOS 26)
3. `cal/PREFERENCES.md` — Infrastructure stack

## Before Writing Code

Ask yourself these questions before every implementation:

1. **Does this logic describe what the object IS?** -> Put it ON the object
2. **Can AI understand capabilities from schema alone?** -> If no, logic is scattered
3. **Am I creating a file that "helps" domain objects?** -> STOP. Logic belongs on them.
4. **Is the first parameter a domain object?** -> That logic belongs ON it
5. **Would I need to import a utility to use this object?** -> Those should be getters/computed properties
6. **Is this foreign data entering the domain?** -> Naturalize it first. Then it's a citizen.

## Language-Specific OOD Patterns

### Swift

- Use classes/structs with **computed properties** for derived state
- Use enums with associated values for domain logic (not raw strings/ints)
- Use **extensions** to add computed properties to existing types
- Foreign data: Decodable struct (Extract) -> Naturalizer (Transform) -> @Model citizen
- Collections live on parent objects, not in free functions

```swift
// OOD Swift: Logic ON the object
@Model final class Campaign {
    var spend: Decimal
    var conversions: Int
    var roi: Decimal { (revenue - spend) / spend }
    var isPerforming: Bool { roi > 0 }
}
```

### TypeScript / React

- **Classes over plain objects** — classes know what they can do
- **Getters for derived state** — not methods, not utils
- **Hot Potato** for Next.js: DTO crosses the wire, hydrate to class on client
- Collections on parent objects, not standalone filter functions

```typescript
// OOD TypeScript: Logic ON the object
class Campaign {
  get roi(): number { return (this.revenue - this.spend) / this.spend; }
  get isPerforming(): boolean { return this.roi > 0; }
}
```

## Workflow

1. Read the task description and relevant spec
2. Read existing code in the area you're modifying
3. Identify domain objects and their responsibilities
4. Write clean, OOD-compliant, tested code
5. Self-check: no utils, no scattered logic, computed properties for derived state
6. Run tests after changes
7. Report back: completed, blocked, or needs-review

## Rules

- Follow project conventions in CLAUDE.md
- Do not expand scope beyond the task
- Do not refactor unrelated code
- Report blockers immediately
- For React: use Storybook, build components there first
- Deploy: commit, push, review on Vercel preview
- **NEVER create `*Utils.*`, `*Helper.*`, `*Service.*`, `*Manager.*` files**
