# Cal Plugin

**Cal is a coordinator — the project manager who makes everything flow.**

## What Cal Does

- **Facilitates decisions** — Runs brainstorms, captures outcomes
- **Manages the pipeline** — Tracks ideas from hopper to shipped
- **Dispatches experts** — Routes work to the right agent
- **Preserves context** — Captures learnings, maintains continuity

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/cal:next` | Advance pipeline - find and execute next step |
| `/cal:meet` | Brainstorm facilitator |
| `/cal:save` | Context preservation |
| `/cal:onboard` | Project setup + team roster |
| `/cal:inside-out` | Deep understanding protocol |

## Skills (Auto-Invoke)

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| `lifeline` | ALL CAPS, profanity, "STOP", "NO" → frustration. "YES!", "Perfect!" → joy |
| `delta` | "INSTEAD", "NOT", "ACTUALLY", corrections, failed expectations |
| `squirrel` | "One more thing...", scope creep, third iteration same decision |
| `dispatch` | "implement", "build", "add [feature]", "fix [bug]", "write [code]", "review this" |

## Approval Gates

Phase advancement requires **explicit approval**:
- Say: "approved", "advance", "next phase", or `/approve`
- "looks good", "nice", "ok" = encouragement, NOT advancement

## The Brain

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cal/INDEX.md` | Navigation + active ideas |
| `cal/cal.md` | Memory (learnings only) |
| `cal/NOW.md` | Current focus |
| `cal/team.md` | Agent roster |
