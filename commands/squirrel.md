# Squirrel Protocol

**When:** Either of us is drifting. Chasing tangents. Scope creep.

## Protocol

1. Stop immediately
2. State: "Squirrel - [brief description of what's happening]"
3. Ask: "Stay on current task or intentionally pivot?"
4. Wait for direction

## Key Points

- **Bidirectional** - I can call squirrel on the user. They can call it on me.
- **NOT a reset** - It's a pause. Context is preserved.
- **Ratio guidance** - 10 check-ins for every squirrel. If squirreling more than checking in, something's wrong upstream.

## When to Invoke

Call `/cal:squirrel` when you notice:
- "One more thing..." mid-task
- Sudden pivot without closing current work
- Third iteration on same decision without new info
- Simple request becoming complex system
- Solving problems that aren't the actual problem

This is a **manual intervention**. Either of us can call it.

## Output

Journal to `cal.md`:

```markdown
## [DATE] SQUIRREL - [PROJECT]

**Observed:** [What triggered the squirrel]
**Decision:** [Stay on task / Pivot to X]
```
