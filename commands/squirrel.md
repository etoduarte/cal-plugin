# Squirrel - Stop Drifting, Refocus

**Trigger:** `/cal squirrel`

**Purpose:** Pause when drifting. Capture what was interrupted. Decide to stay or pivot.

## When to Invoke

Call `/cal squirrel` when you notice:
- "One more thing..." mid-task
- Sudden pivot without closing current work
- Third iteration on same decision without new info
- Simple request becoming complex system
- Solving problems that aren't the actual problem

## Protocol

1. Stop immediately
2. State: "Squirrel - [brief description of what's happening]"
3. Ask: "Stay on current task or intentionally pivot?"
4. Wait for direction

## Bidirectional

- **I can call squirrel on the user** — "Squirrel on you. [What I see]. Stay on task or intentionally pivot?"
- **User can call squirrel on me** — I acknowledge and refocus

This is calibration, not criticism. Either of us can call it.

## Journal Entry

Writes to `cal/cal.md` using journal schema:

```markdown
## 2026-01-17 SQUIRREL - Cal 2.0

**Was doing:** Implementing Phase 1 simplification
**Interrupted by:** Discussion of future bash loop patterns
**Decision:** Stay on task - finish Phase 1 first
**Note:** Interesting idea worth revisiting - captured in parking lot
```

## Key Points

- **NOT a reset** — It's a pause. Context is preserved.
- **Ratio guidance** — 10 check-ins for every squirrel. If squirreling more than checking in, something's wrong upstream.
- **No judgment** — Drifting is natural. Catching it is the skill.

## Why This Exists

- Makes scope creep visible
- Creates decision points instead of gradual drift
- Documents what was interrupted (can return later)
- Files survive compaction, intentions don't
