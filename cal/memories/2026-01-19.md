## Meeting: Cal Journal Separation

**Topic:** Addressing unbounded cal.md growth from real-world usage

### Key Insights

1. **Log vs Learning** — Session saves (point-in-time context) mixed with deltas (timeless learnings) caused unbounded growth. Agent review outputs are *outputs*, not *learnings*.

2. **Extract the learning, let the output vanish** — Agent outputs are scaffolding. Once acted upon, only the extracted insight matters.

3. **Archive is opt-in exception** — Default archiving just moves the pile.

4. **Meetings are just another thing that happened that day** — No need for separate folder structure.

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Split save routing by type | Permanent learnings separate from ephemeral session context |
| Session saves → `cal/memories/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Timestamped, easy to prune |
| Archive is opt-in only | Prevents building a different kind of pile |
| Prune is interactive review | User decides, Cal identifies candidates |
| 300-line target for cal.md | Keeps journal readable |
| Meeting minutes → daily memory file | No separate meeting folders |

### Files Changed

- `commands/save.md` — Split routing, "extract the learning" guidance
- `commands/archive.md` — New, opt-in exception storage
- `commands/prune.md` — New, interactive cleanup
- `commands/meet.md` — Minutes to memories, no folders
- `CLAUDE.md` — Updated structure

### Open Questions

- Should memories auto-suggest deletion after 7 days, or just flag in prune?
- Is 300 lines the right threshold?
