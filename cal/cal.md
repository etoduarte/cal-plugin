### 2025-01-17 - Onboarding

**What happened:** Cal onboarded itself. The cobbler's children now have shoes.

**Coworkers installed:**
- architect (opus) - system coherence, coupling, boundaries
- atomizer (sonnet) - extraction, deduplication, file limits
- drift-preventer (sonnet) - recurring patterns, institutional memory

**Note:** No spec-cleaner template exists yet. Consider creating one for Cal's own specs/templates hygiene.

**Next suggested:** Run `/cal:inside-out session codebase` to populate agent context.
