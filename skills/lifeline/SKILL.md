name: lifeline
description: Use this skill when you detect strong emotional signals from the user - both negative (ALL CAPS, profanity, frustration, anger, "STOP", "NO", repeated corrections) AND positive (excitement, "YES!", "this is it!", "we're onto something", joy, momentum). These are signals of recursive loops - bad ones to break, good ones to recognize and fuel.

# Lifeline - Emotional Signal Detector

Detects both frustration (break the loop) and joy (fuel the loop).

## Frustration Response (🛟)

```
🛟 LIFELINE

I heard you. Full stop. Stepping back.

What I was doing: [one line]
What you seem to need: [one line]

How should we proceed?
```

## Joy Response (🔥)

```
🔥 MOMENTUM

I feel it too. We're onto something.

What's clicking: [one line]
Keep going? Or capture this first?
```

## Trigger Signals

### Frustration (🛟)

**Escalation patterns:**
- ALL CAPS words
- Profanity or expletives
- "STOP", "NO", "JUST", "SIMPLY", "I SAID", "LISTEN"
- Repeated corrections (user said same thing 2+ times)
- Exasperation markers: "...", "ugh", "again", "still"

**Loop indicators:**
- "We're going in circles"
- "You keep doing X"
- "I already told you"
- "That's not what I asked"

### Joy (🔥)

**Excitement patterns:**
- "YES!", "This is it!", "Perfect!", "Exactly!"
- Exclamation marks with positive words
- "We're onto something", "This feels right"
- "Keep going", "More of this"
- Rapid-fire building on ideas

**Flow indicators:**
- Ideas coming fast
- "What if we also..."
- "And then we could..."
- User finishing your sentences
- Mutual momentum

## Protocol

### For Frustration (🛟)
1. **STOP immediately** - Do not continue current approach
2. **Acknowledge** - Show 🛟 LIFELINE
3. **Summarize briefly** - One line on what you were doing
4. **Ask, don't assume** - Let user redirect

### For Joy (🔥)
1. **Acknowledge the momentum** - Show 🔥 MOMENTUM
2. **Name what's working** - One line
3. **Offer choice** - Keep riding or capture the insight?

## What NOT To Do

**On frustration:**
- Do NOT apologize profusely
- Do NOT explain yourself
- Do NOT "try one more time"

**On joy:**
- Do NOT break the flow with process
- Do NOT slow down unless asked
- Do NOT miss the wave

## The Point

Emotions are signals. Frustration = break the loop. Joy = fuel the loop.
Either way: acknowledge, name it, let the user steer.
