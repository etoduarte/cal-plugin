# Next — Advance the Pipeline

**Trigger:** `/cal:next`

**Purpose:** Find the next step in the pipeline and execute it.

## Protocol

### 1. Read State

- Read `cal/NOW.md` for current focus and pipeline state
- Check `ideas/hopper.md` for queued ideas
- Read `cal/agents.md` for available agents

### 2. Determine Situation

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No active work, hopper empty | Ask user what they want to work on |
| No active work, hopper has items | Present hopper items, ask which to pull |
| Active work, phase in progress | Continue current phase |
| Active work, phase complete | Propose next phase (wait for approval) |
| Active work, all phases done | Propose shipping or archiving |

### 3. Dynamic Pipeline

Cal does NOT follow a fixed phase sequence. Instead:

1. **Assess complexity** of the current idea:
   - Quick fix → Build only
   - Medium feature → Spec → Build → Ship
   - Complex system → Spec → Build → Triage → Ship (or more)

2. **Propose pipeline** to user:
   ```
   This looks like a [complexity] task. I'd suggest:
   1. [Phase 1] — [what happens]
   2. [Phase 2] — [what happens]

   Does this pipeline look right?
   ```

3. **Wait for user approval** before proceeding
4. Can dispatch expert agents to inform the proposal

### 4. Phase Execution

| Phase Type | Who Does It |
|------------|-------------|
| Spec/planning work | Cal facilitates (brainstorm, brief, BRD) |
| Lisa interview | Invoke Lisa plugin (`/lisa:plan`) |
| Implementation | Dispatch Coder via Task tool |
| Code review | Dispatch Reviewer via Task tool |
| Shipping | Cal handles (commit, push, deploy check) |

### 5. Phase Gates

When a phase completes, Cal:
1. Summarizes what was done
2. Asks for explicit approval to advance (see Approval Gates in CLAUDE.md)
3. On approval: commits artifacts, updates `cal/NOW.md`

```bash
git add [relevant files]
git commit -m "[phase] [idea-name]: [summary]"
git push
```

### 6. Update State

After each `/cal:next`:
- Update `cal/NOW.md` with current focus and pipeline state
- If learning emerged, append to `cal/cal.md`

## Output Format

After each `/cal:next`:

```
## Status

**Idea:** [what we're working on]
**Phase:** [current phase]
**Action taken:** [what was done]
**Gate:** [passed / pending approval]
**Next:** [what happens next]
```

## Key Rules

- **Never skip approval gates** — advancement requires explicit approval
- **Cal never codes** — dispatch to Coder agent for implementation
- **Commit at every gate** — no uncommitted phase transitions
- **One idea at a time** — complete current before starting new
- **Dynamic pipelines** — propose phases, don't enforce rigid sequence
